		<h4>What I did before bootcamp</h4>		
		<div style="text-align: center;">
    		<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">
		<p>
		Prior to the bootcamp, I worked as a substitute teacher,<br>
		at different schools around Cincinnati.  The subjects that<br>
		I had specific training for were Middle School Science and <br>
		Language Arts (grades 4-9), but due to the fluid nature of<br>
		substitute teaching, I taught a variety of topics.
		</p>
			</div>
		</div>		
		<h4>Why I chose to do a bootcamp</h4>		
		<div style="text-align: center;">
    		<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">
		<p>
		While teaching would be my "first love"	as a career choice, I<br>
		did not succeed in making the transition from the temporary<br>
		state of substituting to a full-time position.  As I greatly<br>
		desired to have a stable career, I investigated options that<br>
		would let me utilize my fondness for computers, and help me<br>
		start a career.  With the high ratings earned by Max Techincal<br>
		Training, I quickly signed up to study with the bootcamp.
		</p>

		</div>
		<h4>Where I want to work after bootcamp</h4>		
		<div style="text-align: center;">
    		<div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left">
		<p>
		As of yet, I do not have a specific place in mind for where I<br>
		would like to work.  There are some areas that could be interesting,<br>
		such as working with the Cincinnati Museum Center or City Hall, but<br>
		I am primarily searching for an environment where everyone has a<br>
		great deal of pride in their work.
