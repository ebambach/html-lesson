			Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
			And sorry I could not travel both<br>
			And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
			And looked down one as far as I could<br>
			To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
			And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
			Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
			Though as for that the passing there<br>
			Had worn them really about the same,<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			And both that morning equally lay<br>
			In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
			Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
			Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
			I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
			Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
			Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
			I took the one less traveled by,<br>
			And that has made all the difference.<br>
